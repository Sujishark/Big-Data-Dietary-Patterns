# Big-Data-Dietary-Patterns
The dietary patterns of people around us are obtained and are analysed and classified based on various factors like age, gender, BMI, exercise patterns, vitamin needs, habit of eating junk foods, usage of other animal products (like leather), price of the foods, health consciousness, moral values and culture and the reasons that make them follow a particular diet pattern.

The data obtained is analysed using Weka â€“ a data mining tool.
